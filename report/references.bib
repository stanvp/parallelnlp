  abstract =	"Implementing machine learning algorithms for large
		 data, such as the Web graph and social networks, is
		 challenging. Even though much research has focused on
		 making sequential algorithms more scalable, their
		 running times continue to be prohibitively long.
		 Meanwhile, parallelization remains a formidable
		 challenge for this class of problems, despite
		 frameworks like MapReduce which hide much of the
		 associated complexity. We present a framework for
		 implementing parallel and distributed machine learning
		 algorithms on large graphs, flexibly, through the use
		 of functional programming abstractions. Our aim is a
		 system that allows researchers and practitioners to
		 quickly and easily implement (and experiment with)
		 their algorithms in a parallel or distributed setting.
		 We introduce functional combinators for the flexible
		 composition of parallel, aggregation, and sequential
		 steps. To the best of our knowledge, our system is the
		 first to avoid inversion of control in a (bulk)
		 synchronous parallel model.",

		 solutions to some of the problems with Naive Bayes

  abstract =	"This paper proposes the use of maximum entropy
		 techniques for text classification. Maximum entropy is
		 a probability distribution estimation technique widely
		 used for a variety of natural language tasks, such as
		 language modeling, part-of-speech tagging, and text
		 segmentation. The underlying principle of maximum
		 entropy is that without external knowledge, one should
		 prefer distributions that are uniform. Constraints on
		 the distribution, derived from labeled training data,
		 inform maximum entropy where to be minimally
		 non-uniform. The maximum entropy formulation has a
		 unique solution which can be found by the improved
		 iterative scaling algorithm. In text classification
		 tasks, maximum entropy is used to estimate the
		 conditional distribution of the class variable given
		 the document. Experiments on several text datasets show
		 that maximum entropy performance is sometimes
		 significantly better, but also sometimes worse, than
		 naive Bayes text classification. Much future work
